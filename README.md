# Abstract

An increasing number of countries have recently cracked down on
non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Much of this crackdown is
sanctioned by law and represents a bureaucratic form of repression that
could indicate more severe human rights abuses in the future. This is
especially the case for democracies, which unlike autocracies, may not
aggressively attack civic space. We explore if crackdowns on NGOs
predict broader human rights repression. Anti-NGO laws are among the
most subtle means of repression and attract lesser domestic and
international condemnation compared to the use of violence. Using
original data on NGO repression, we test whether NGO crackdown is a
predictor of political terror, and violations of physical integrity
rights and civil liberties. We find that while de jure anti-NGO laws
provide little information in predicting future repression, their
patterns of implementation—or de facto civil society repression—predicts
worsening respect for physical integrity rights and civil liberties.

### ⚠️🐦: “Cautioning canary” project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting,
and peer review, we use “cautioning canary” as an internal-to-us project
name that won’t change. (We chose this name before the
[**codename**](http://svmiller.com/codename/) was invented—had it
existed already, we would have used that to generate the name.)
